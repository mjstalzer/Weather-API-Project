# Weather-API-Project

  * This project required me to implement the OpenWeather API to extract real time weather for today and a 5 day forecast.
      * I had to dynamically create html elements using jQuery to display the weather data for the user input.
      * The single day weather was rather simple after I had console logged each piece of data.
      * The five day forecast required a more difficult approach with a for loop and if statement inside.
      * Finally, I had to store all of the responses in local storage and keep info from disappearing on a page refresh.
